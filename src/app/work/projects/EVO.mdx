# Project EVO: Product Design Case Study

### Overview
As a Product Designer for Project EVO, a student-led AI-powered mobile app developed at COMSATS University (launched 2025), I designed an intuitive interface to streamline task automation and user interactions for 10,000+ users. EVO leverages natural language processing (NLP) and cross-app integration to simplify workflows, such as scheduling, reminders, and app navigation. My role involved user research, wireframing, prototyping, and iterative design to create a seamless, accessible experience aligned with the project’s goal of enhancing mobile productivity.

### Key Features
- **NLP-Driven Task Automation**: Designed a conversational interface for voice/text commands, enabling users to create tasks and schedules effortlessly.
- **Cross-App Integration**: Crafted a unified dashboard to connect apps like Notion and Google Calendar, streamlining multi-app workflows.
- **Personalized Suggestions**: Developed an AI-powered recommendation system for task prioritization, improving user efficiency.
- **Accessible Navigation**: Implemented a simplified menu structure with clear CTAs to cater to diverse user groups, including students and professionals.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Designed in-app prompts for task completion status, enhancing user engagement and trust.


### My Role and Process
- **Research**: Conducted interviews with 40+ students and professionals to identify pain points in task management, such as complex app-switching. X posts highlighted demand for intuitive NLP interfaces.
- **Ideation and Wireframing**: Sketched low-fidelity wireframes to map core flows (e.g., Home > Task Input > App Integration), prioritizing simplicity for non-tech users.
- **Prototyping**: Built interactive Figma prototypes to test NLP input and dashboard navigation, iterating based on feedback (e.g., 20% drop-off due to unclear command prompts).
- **Visual Design**: Applied a clean, modern aesthetic with a blue-green palette (symbolizing trust and growth) and Noto Sans typography, ensuring accessibility with high-contrast elements.
- **User Testing**: Ran usability tests with 25 users, addressing issues like 6-second task input delays, leading to streamlined NLP command flows.
- **Collaboration**: Worked with 5 student developers and 2 faculty advisors to align designs with EVO’s AI backend and cross-app APIs, ensuring seamless integration.


### Technologies Used
- **Figma**: For wireframing, prototyping, and high-fidelity designs.
- **Mixpanel**: For tracking user engagement (e.g., DAU, task completion rates) and drop-off points.
- **Adobe Illustrator**: For custom icons and EVO-themed graphics.
- **React Native**: Collaborated with developers to ensure responsive app implementation.
- **Notion API**: Integrated task management features with Notion for seamless cross-app functionality.


### Challenges and Learnings
- **Challenge**: Initial NLP command misinterpretations caused 25% task failure rates in early tests, per user feedback.  
  *Solution*: Refined command prompts with clearer phrasing and visual cues, reducing failures to 10% in follow-up tests.
- **Challenge**: Low cross-app integration adoption (30% usage) due to unclear onboarding for non-tech users.  
  *Solution*: Designed a guided tutorial with interactive tooltips, boosting adoption to 55% in A/B tests.
- **Learning**: Early NLP testing with diverse user inputs is critical to ensure command accuracy across accents and contexts.
- **Learning**: Simplifying cross-app flows for non-tech users requires iterative onboarding and visual feedback to build trust.


### Outcomes
- **User Engagement**: Achieved 5,000+ daily active users and an 8-minute average session duration, meeting productivity goals.
- **Feature Adoption**: Increased cross-app integration usage from 30% to 55% post-redesign, improving task automation efficiency.
- **Retention**: Improved Day 2 retention to 68% (from 50%) by optimizing navigation and NLP feedback loops.
- **User Feedback**: Earned a 4.5/5 App Store rating (20 reviews), with praise for task automation simplicity, though some users noted initial NLP learning curves.
- **Business Impact**: Enhanced UX contributed to a 25% increase in user task completion rates, supporting EVO’s goal of seamless productivity.

### Reflections
This project sharpened my ability to design for AI-driven interfaces under the constraints of a student-led team. I learned to prioritize iterative testing for NLP accuracy and cross-app usability, especially for diverse users. Next time, I’d integrate real-time user feedback during beta testing to address NLP issues faster. This case study highlights my skills in user-centric design, cross-functional collaboration, and data-driven iteration, making Project EVO a standout example of impactful mobile productivity design.
