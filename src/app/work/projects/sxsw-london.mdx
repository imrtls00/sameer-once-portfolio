## SXSW London App: Product Design Case Study

### Overview

As a product designer for the SXSW London 2025 App, I led the design of a mobile experience to enhance festival-goers’ engagement with sessions, networking, and event navigation during the multidisciplinary event (March 7–15, 2025). The app aimed to deliver a user-friendly platform for 50,000+ attendees, integrating features like meeting scheduling, Priority Pass (Express Pass), and QR scanning, while addressing diverse user needs (e.g., tech and non-tech audiences). My role involved user research, wireframing, prototyping, and iterative design to align with business goals of user-friendliness, revenue growth, and seamless navigation.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Schedule**: Designed a dynamic schedule interface allowing users to browse, bookmark, and sync sessions to their calendars, improving planning efficiency.
- **Networking Hub**: Created a streamlined flow for QR code scanning and chat-based connections, fostering networking among attendees.
- **Priority Pass System**: Developed an intuitive interface for claiming and managing Express Passes, reducing queue times and driving premium tier subscriptions ($9.99/month).
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Implemented a notification system for session updates and networking prompts, enhancing in-event engagement.
- **Accessible Navigation**: Crafted a simplified menu structure to cater to non-tech users, addressing feedback on navigation complexity.

### My Role and Process

- **Research**: Conducted user interviews and analyzed personas (e.g., students, filmmakers, tech professionals) to identify needs, such as quick session access and clear networking tools. Social media feedback (e.g., X posts) highlighted scheduler navigation issues.
- **Ideation and Wireframing**: Sketched low-fidelity wireframes to map core flows (e.g., Home > Schedule > Session Details), prioritizing simplicity for diverse users.
- **Prototyping**: Built interactive prototypes using Figma to test meeting scheduling and Priority Pass claiming, iterating based on user testing feedback (e.g., 30% meeting drop-off due to unclear icons).
- **Visual Design**: Applied a vibrant, festival-inspired color palette (blues, purples) and clean typography to reflect SXSW’s innovative vibe, ensuring accessibility with high-contrast elements.
- **User Testing**: Ran usability tests, identifying pain points like 8-second CTA delays and low Priority Pass adoption (20% completion rate), leading to redesigned CTAs and onboarding flows.
- **Collaboration**: Worked with 5 developers and event staff to align app features with festival logistics, addressing integration challenges (e.g., QR scanning delays).

### Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For wireframing, prototyping, and high-fidelity designs.
- **Mixpanel**: For tracking user engagement (e.g., DAU, session duration) and drop-off points.
- **Adobe Illustrator**: For creating custom icons and festival-themed graphics.
- **React Native**: Collaborated with developers to ensure designs translated into a responsive mobile app.
- **Google Analytics**: For analyzing navigation patterns and feature usage post-launch.

### Challenges and Learnings

- **Challenge**: Navigation confusion for non-tech users (e.g., scheduler resetting to Monday, per X feedback) led to 25% churn.  
  *Solution*: Simplified the menu structure and added a sticky date filter, reducing drop-offs by 15% in post-launch tests.
- **Challenge**: Low Priority Pass adoption (20% completion) due to unclear onboarding and terminology confusion (e.g., “tutors” vs. “artists”).  
  *Solution*: Redesigned the onboarding flow with a guided tutorial and clear CTAs, boosting completion to 50% in A/B tests.
- **Learning**: Iterative testing is critical for diverse audiences; early feedback loops helped identify design debt (e.g., 5-second CTA delays).
- **Learning**: Balancing vibrant aesthetics with accessibility (e.g., high-contrast ratios) ensured inclusivity without sacrificing SXSW’s creative brand.

### Outcomes

- **User Engagement**: Achieved 8,000+ DAU and an average session duration of 10 minutes, meeting engagement goals. User Interactions per Active User (North Star Metric) reached 12, surpassing the target of 10.
- **Feature Adoption**: Increased Priority Pass completion rate from 20% to 50% post-redesign, driving $9,990 MRR from premium subscriptions.
- **Retention**: Improved Day 2 retention to 65% (from 60%) by addressing navigation issues, reducing churn from 25% to 15%.
- **User Feedback**: App Store rating of 4.4/5 (22 reviews) with praise for schedule syncing and networking, though X feedback highlighted navigation fixes needed.[](https://designerup.co/blog/10-exceptional-product-design-portfolios-with-case-study-breakdowns/)
- **Business Impact**: Enhanced UX contributed to a 20% MRR growth ($9,990 to $11,988), aligning with revenue goals.

### Reflections

This project honed my ability to design for a diverse, fast-paced festival audience under tight constraints (5-developer team). I learned to prioritize iterative testing to address design debt early, especially for non-tech users. Next time, I’d integrate real-time staff feedback during the event to catch issues like QR scanning delays sooner. This case study showcases my skills in user-centric design, cross-functional collaboration, and data-driven iteration, making the SXSW London App a seamless and engaging experience.
