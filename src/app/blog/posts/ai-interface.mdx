AI-driven apps like Project EVO, with its NLP task automation, demand intuitive interfaces. Users struggled with complex command inputs, causing 25% task failures. I redesigned the NLP interface with clear prompts and visual cues, boosting success rates to 90%.

AI-powered apps can overwhelm users if interfaces aren’t intuitive. Complex input fields or unclear prompts often lead to task failures. The key is designing simple, conversational flows that guide users naturally, like clear text prompts or visual cues for voice commands. Prototyping tools like Figma help test these flows, revealing issues like slow response times. Iterative user testing is crucial—feedback from diverse users can cut errors significantly. I focus on minimizing steps and adding real-time feedback to build trust. Designers can simplify AI by prioritizing clarity and testing relentlessly to ensure seamless interactions for all users.

**Key Takeaway**: Simplify AI interactions with iterative testing. For EVO, I used Figma prototypes to test voice/text inputs, reducing drop-offs by 15%. Designers can apply this by focusing on clear CTAs and real-time feedback for AI features.
