As a Figma Instructor at RAS, I mentored 20+ students in a 6-week bootcamp, teaching prototyping and UI design. This led to 80% of participants completing portfolio projects, with 5 securing internships.

**Key Takeaway**: Mentorship amplifies impact. I used hands-on workshops to teach `Figma` workflows, boosting student confidence. Designers can mentor by sharing practical skills and encouraging iterative feedback.
