At Blink Global, I built a headless design system with 35+ reusable components, reducing iteration time by 30%. Managing design tokens for three app brands ensured consistency across platforms like SXSW and Super Bowl LIX.


**Key Takeaway**: Centralize design systems for efficiency. I used Figma to maintain a “Source of Truth” file, streamlining developer handoffs. Designers can adopt this by creating modular components and documenting tokens early.

<Table
  data={{
    headers: [
      { content: "Component", key: "component", sortable: true },
      { content: "Purpose", key: "purpose", sortable: true }
    ],
    rows: [
      ["Button", "Trigger actions with consistent styling"],
      ["Card", "Group related content for events"],
      ["Input Field", "Standardize user input forms"]
    ]
  }}
/>
