Event apps like SXSW London’s must balance vibrant aesthetics with usability. Navigation issues led to 25% churn. I simplified the menu and added a sticky date filter, improving retention to 65% and achieving 8,000+ daily active users.

Event apps need to balance vibrant aesthetics with ease of use to keep users engaged. Complex menus can frustrate attendees, causing drop-offs. Simplifying navigation—like using sticky filters or clear CTAs—can improve retention. User testing helps identify pain points, such as slow feature access, and iterative redesigns can lift engagement metrics. I emphasize designing for diverse audiences, ensuring non-tech users find the app intuitive. Incorporating real-time notifications also keeps users connected. Designers should focus on streamlined flows and vibrant visuals, testing with varied groups to create engaging, inclusive experiences that drive participation.

**Key Takeaway**: Prioritize usability for diverse audiences. I conducted usability tests to refine CTAs, increasing Priority Pass adoption by 30%. Designers can enhance event apps by streamlining navigation and testing with varied user groups.
